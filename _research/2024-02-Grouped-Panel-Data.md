We propose a new method-of-moments based toolkit to test for return predictability in the panel data setting with general predictors and cross-section dependence. Our proposed toolkit is based on overidentified method-of-moments based procedures that accommodate both the settings with strong as well as weak instruments. We argue that in the setting with several potential predictors in the panel setting, it is a desirable property that any proposed procedure can generate empty confidence intervals, thus indicating misspecification of the postulated model. The proposed procedure is illustrated both using real and simulated data. Our empirical results mostly confirm previously documented evidence of predictability from short-term interest rates and term spreads on excess stock returns.'
