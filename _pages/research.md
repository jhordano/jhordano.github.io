**Grouped heterogeneity in linear panel data models with heterogeneous error variances**

*Joint with [Tom Boot](https://sites.google.com/view/tomboot).* 

We develop a procedure to identify latent group structures in linear panel data models that exploits a grouping in the error variances of cross-sectional units. To accommodate such grouping, we introduce an objective function that avoids a singularity that arises in a pseudo-likelihood approach. We provide theoretical and numerical evidence showing when allowing for variance groups improves classification. The developed procedure provides new evidence on the relation between firm-level R&D investments and the business cycle. We find a well-defined group structure in the variances that ex-post can be related to firm size. Our estimates indicate stronger procyclical investment patterns at medium-size firms compared to large firms.

**Misspecification and Identification Robust Predictability Testing with General Predictors**

*Joint with [Lammertjan Dam](https://www.rug.nl/staff/l.dam/) and [ArtÅ«ras Juodis](https://sites.google.com/site/ajuodisresearch/).* 

We propose a new method-of-moments based toolkit to test for return predictability in the panel data setting with general predictors and cross-section dependence. Our proposed toolkit is based on overidentified method-of-moments based procedures that accommodate both the settings with strong as well as weak instruments. We argue that in the setting with several potential predictors in the panel setting, it is a desirable property that any proposed procedure can generate empty confidence intervals, thus indicating misspecification of the postulated model. The proposed procedure is illustrated both using real and simulated data. Our empirical results mostly confirm previously documented evidence of predictability from short-term interest rates and term spreads on excess stock returns.'
